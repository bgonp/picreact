In the picture above, look at this number **5**, this means there are 5 filled cells in that row, so you can fill all of them like in the picture below.

Awesome! You filled your first cells. Notice how this number **5** is now lighter, that's because you satisfied this condition.

Now look at this number **2** in the picture above, this means there are 2 **consecutive** filled cells, so you can fill your next cell as you can see in following image.

Look at these numbers in the picture above, they all are light and they have no others numbers, so you can conclude there are no others filled cells on its respective column/rows. Let's mark all of them with **crosses** as in the picture below.
